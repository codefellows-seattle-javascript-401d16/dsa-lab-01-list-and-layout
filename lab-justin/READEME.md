# Data structure and algorithm challenge.

This is a data structure projects that emphasizes on functional programing.

Here I am creating a list constructor that is a replacement for arrays

In list.js, there are different methods for this constructor that include push, pop, map, filter, reduce, and slice.

This was a fun and challenging project.
