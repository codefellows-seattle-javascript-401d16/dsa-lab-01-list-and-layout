## Description
401 JS -- Class 05 fs async lab

Took Duncan's demo code and started from there. Decided to start with the reduce function. After much trial and error and a bunch of looking around the internet I got it to work. Tests for it passes. Moved on to map next writing the tests first this time. Had to tweak it a little but got it to pass. Decided to write tests for both filter and slice before starting on the actual functions since thats easy. Took a little bit but got filter to work. Finally started working on slice. Got it to work the first time when using two values but not when using only one. After tweaking it slightly I got it to work with just one value. In summary reduce was a pain in the ass and took me several hours and multiple internet searches to get. Everything else took no more than thirty minutes.
