# This application creates a new array-like object, List, which behaves like an array.

I have reproduced the following Array.prototype methods and attached them to List.

- push
- map
- pop
- filter
- reduce
- slice

## Directions

To run, type the following in the Node CLI (command line interface):

node index.js arguments

This will create a new List (Array-like object) and run it with the given arguments through each of the aforementioned methods. The results will be logged in the terminal.
