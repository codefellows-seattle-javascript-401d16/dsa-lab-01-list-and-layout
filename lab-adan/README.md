## Array with List

The goal of this module is to create the Array object from scratch, calling it List.

Methods I created for List

.push()
.pop()
.reduce()
.map()
.filter()
.slice()

## Testing

I wrote multiple tests for each method to ensure that it works correctly under any condition an Array would.
