# DSA List & Layout
\n
# I created a list constructor that is a replacement for Arrays, and I added push, pop, slice, reduce (map and filter included) methods to the constructor.
\n
# Then I wrote tests for each method and typed things in until they passed.
\n
# I don't know if I did it right but I tried to implement map and filter using reduce.
